# Weather Forcaster

## Description

This weather app was designed with travelers in mind. The user is able to search for different cities and view the forcast for those locations so they can plan their trip accordingly. One of the challenging aspects of this project was that the forcast is called using latitute and longitude coordinates but users are able to search by city. 

During this project I learned:
- how to limit which characters are accepted in the input without using an array
- how to call a function from keystrokes on the HTML side
- how to find and resolve minor bugs

## Usage

Input the name of a city in the upper right search box and press search. Successful searches will populate forcast cards and unsucessful searches will result in an alert to try again. Both result in storing buttons related to those terms on the right-hand side. Successful searches yield clickable buttons that will re-populate the forcast for that city. Upon revisiting the app, the landing page will load with the stored history buttons.

I used a tutorial to disallow numerical and special character inputs into the search bar: [Oston Code Cypher via YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EduFuZzvWP8)
